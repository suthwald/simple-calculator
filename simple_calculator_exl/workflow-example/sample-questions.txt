Basic Weather and Time Query:
Query: "What's the weather and time in New York?"
Expected Behavior:

Agent1 uses get_weather and get_time separately to fetch the weather ("Sunny, 25°C in New York") and the current time in New York’s timezone.
Agent2 uses get_weather_and_time to fetch both in a combined response.
The Supervisor combines the results into a coherent answer, e.g., "In New York, it is sunny with a temperature of 25°C. The current time is [current time in America/New_York]."




Weather-Only Query:
Query: "Tell me the weather in New York."
Expected Behavior:

Agent1 uses get_weather to return "Sunny, 25°C in New York."
Agent2 uses get_weather_and_time, which includes the weather report.
The Supervisor prioritizes the weather information, likely responding with "The weather in New York is sunny, 25°C."




Time-Only Query:
Query: "What is the current time in New York?"
Expected Behavior:

Agent1 uses get_time to return the current time in New York’s timezone.
Agent2 uses get_weather_and_time, which includes the time.
The Supervisor focuses on the time, e.g., "The current time in New York is [current time in America/New_York]."




Combined Query with Context:
Query: "Can you give me the weather and time for New York right now?"
Expected Behavior: Similar to the first query, both agents fetch weather and time data, and the Supervisor combines them into a single response, e.g., "In New York, it’s currently sunny at 25°C, and the time is [current time]."


Invalid City Query:
Query: "What's the weather and time in London?"
Expected Behavior:

Both agents return an error since the mock tools only support New York (e.g., "No weather for London" and "No time for London").
The Supervisor notes the error and responds, e.g., "Sorry, I can only provide weather and time information for New York."




Ambiguous Query:
Query: "Tell me about New York."
Expected Behavior:

The agents interpret this as a request for weather and time (based on their instructions).
The Supervisor provides a combined response with both weather and time, or notes any discrepancies if the agents interpret the query differently.




Edge Case Query:
Query: "What’s the weather and time in new york?" (lowercase)
Expected Behavior:

The mock tools handle the lowercase input correctly (since they use city.lower() == "new york"), so the response should be the same as the first query.
